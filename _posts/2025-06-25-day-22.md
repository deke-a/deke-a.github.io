what_i_learned: |
  I finally finished gathering all the news articles for the countries we’re covering in the African diaspora project. I made sure each article was clearly labeled by time period—pre-slavery, during slavery, and post-slavery—and included the title and author for proper documentation. I’ve learned how to quickly identify credible sources and double-check information for accuracy. Completing this part of the project also helped me get better at organizing large sets of information and formatting them in a consistent way for others to use.

reflection: |
  Finishing the article research today felt like a major milestone. It was challenging at times, especially when sources were hard to access or didn’t fully match the time period I needed, but I kept pushing through. I realized how much my ability to assess credibility and organize information has improved over the past week. I feel more confident working with historical data now, and I’m ready to shift my focus to the next phase of the project.

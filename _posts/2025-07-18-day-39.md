what_i_learned: |
  Dr. Kopano introduced us to Dean Jones and Associate Dean Hyden, and my group had the opportunity to present our project to them. They shared thoughtful feedback and offered suggestions on how to improve the direction of our work. After the presentation, I spent the rest of the day refining the datasets and thinking through how to apply some of the ideas they mentioned to strengthen our project. Their input gave me a clearer perspective on what we need to adjust moving forward.

reflection: |
  Presenting our project to Dean Jones and Associate Dean Hyden made me realize how important it is to think beyond the technical parts and consider the bigger picture. Their feedback pointed out areas we hadn’t fully developed and pushed me to think more critically about how our project connects to its intended audience. I appreciated that they didn’t just critique, but also suggested new directions we could explore. It was a reminder that outside perspectives are valuable, especially from people with more experience. Moving forward, I want to be more intentional about incorporating that kind of feedback early on.

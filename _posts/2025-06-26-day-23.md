what_i_learned: |
  I wrapped up the verification of the resources I was working on and uploaded the completed CSV file. While I couldn’t find every single source link, I was able to verify most of the entries and make sure the information was accurate. The process helped me get more comfortable identifying credible sources and figuring out how to handle missing data without compromising the overall quality. It also gave me more practice with organizing content in a way that’s clean and usable for the next steps of the project.

reflection: |
  Verifying the resources made me realize how important it is to balance accuracy with efficiency, especially when not all information is available. I had to make judgment calls about what was reliable and what could be left out, which pushed me to think more critically about sourcing. It also reminded me that even small tasks like cleaning and formatting data are a big part of building something functional. I feel more confident now in handling incomplete datasets and making sure the work I contribute is organized and reliable.

what_i_learned: |
  My group and I spent the day working on our presentation for the mid-summer symposium, making sure our content was clear, organized, and ready to share. We reviewed our project’s goals, refined our talking points, and aligned on who would cover each section. Later, we met with Dr. Brewer, a professor of African diaspora studies, to share our progress and get feedback. The meeting gave us a chance to explain our approach and consider new perspectives that could improve our work moving forward.

reflection: |
  Working on the presentation helped me see how important it is to communicate ideas clearly and as a team. It pushed us to think critically about what parts of the project matter most and how to explain them to others. Meeting with the professor reminded me that there’s always more to learn, especially when working with histories and cultures that deserve accuracy and care. I realized how valuable outside feedback can be, especially from someone with deep knowledge in the field. It made me want to look deeper into the context behind the data we’re presenting.

what_i_learned: |
  Today, Aamari and I begin working on the CSV file for the music and series section of the project. I focus on organizing titles, sources, descriptions, and other key details in a clear format that matches the structure we’ve used in other sections. I also make sure the entries are relevant and representative of different regions in the African diaspora. Later in the day, my team and I give a short presentation to Dr. Kopano’s son, who has traveled to many of the diaspora countries we’re studying. We walk him through the purpose of the project, the tabs we’ve worked on so far, and the impact we hope it will have. He shares some personal insights and travel experiences that give us new ideas and help us think more critically about how we present cultural content.

reflection: |
  Working on the CSV file today reminds me how important consistency and clarity are when organizing data for a larger project. It takes time to format everything properly, but it makes the next steps smoother. Presenting to Dr. Kopano’s son was also helpful—he gave us a fresh perspective from someone who has actually visited many of the countries we’re covering. His input made me think more about how personal experience can add depth to research, and how our work can be more meaningful when it connects with lived realities.

what_i_learned: |
  I spent the day finalizing our project presentation and making sure the slides clearly reflected our research and progress. I reviewed the layout, cleaned up the wording, and helped make sure each section was easy to follow. I also double-checked for any missing information or visuals that needed adjusting. By the end, our slides looked complete, organized, and ready to present to others.

reflection: |
  Finalizing the slides made me realize how important it is to communicate our work clearly and simply. It pushed me to think about how others would understand our project without all the background we have. I also saw how small edits—like rewording or adjusting visuals—can make a big difference in how polished the presentation feels. It was a good reminder that presentation is just as important as the research itself.

what_i_learned: |
  Today, my group and I began working on our 90-second elevator pitch. We drafted a rough script for the video and spent some time practicing how we want to present the key points. We also put together a first draft of the video’s structure and visual direction. While we collaborated on the pitch, I continued refining the datasets for the project, making sure the information was accurate and well-organized. Meanwhile, the rest of my group focused on their individual responsibilities to keep everything moving forward.

reflection: |
  Working on the elevator pitch helped me think about how to communicate our project clearly and quickly. Condensing everything into 90 seconds forced us to focus on the core message and what really matters. It was also useful to get a sense of how the video might look, so we could start aligning our script with the visuals. At the same time, balancing that with finishing the datasets reminded me how important it is to manage time and divide tasks effectively within a team.

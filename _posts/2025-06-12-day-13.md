what_i_learned: |
  Today, I participated in team-building activities with other members of the program. We played Taboo and Jenga, and discussed ideas for future activities like field trips to amusement parks and Washington, D.C. Later, we practiced writing our blog posts using Overleaf, which helped me understand how to format content in LaTeX. After that, I met with my group to continue collecting news articles about countries in the African diaspora. These articles will support the dataset we’re building for our summer project.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me how important it is to balance work and connection. Playing games like Taboo and Jenga with other program members helped me feel more comfortable around everyone, and it was fun hearing new ideas for future activities. Practicing with Overleaf made LaTeX feel less intimidating, and I’m starting to see how useful it can be for documenting work clearly. Meeting back with my group to keep building our dataset brought everything back to focus — it showed me how each part of the program is moving us closer to a shared goal.

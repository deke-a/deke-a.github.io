what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked more with Python dictionaries and sets. I created a simple student gradebook using a dictionary to store and access grades, which helped me understand how to manage structured data. I also used sets to practice operations like adding elements and removing duplicates. Later, we covered file input/output (file I/O) in Python—learning how to open, read, write, append, and close files. Practicing these skills showed me how to save data outside the program.

  Before the Python session, we had a computer vision workshop where we explored how computers process and interpret images. Afterward, we played an escape room game in teams, which was a fun way to build collaboration and problem-solving skills.

reflection: |
  Today built on what I already knew and pushed me further. Working with dictionaries and sets helped me see how Python can organize and handle different types of data. File I/O was completely new to me, but the practice examples made it less intimidating. I also liked the mix of technical and interactive activities—starting with computer vision and ending with a team escape room. It made the day feel balanced and reminded me that both coding and communication are key skills in tech.

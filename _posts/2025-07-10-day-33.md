what_i_learned: |
  I attended a session with the rest of the program members on how to write a research paper. We learned about the standard structure—introduction, literature review, methodology, results, and discussion—and talked about how to stay organized during the writing process. The facilitator also shared tips on how to clearly present our arguments and cite sources properly. After the session, I rejoined my group and continued working on our datasets. We focused on cleaning up the entries and making sure everything is well-formatted for the next phase of the project.

reflection: |
  The session helped me better understand how to approach our research paper in a more structured and intentional way. I used to feel a bit unsure about where to start, but breaking it down into clear sections made it feel more manageable. It also reminded me how important it is to stay organized early on, especially as we work with multiple datasets. Collaborating with my group after the session helped reinforce what I learned, since I could already see how the data we’re collecting will fit into the final paper.

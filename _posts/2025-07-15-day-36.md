what_i_learned: |
  We had a general meeting with all the program members where we took the VARK learning style quiz and the Myers-Briggs personality quiz. After completing both, my group members and I presented our results, shared our individual strengths, and discussed some of the challenges we each face based on our learning and personality types. It was a good way to better understand how we work together as a team. After the session, I returned to work with my group and continued building the dataset for the movies and shows section of the project.

reflection: |
  Taking the VARK and Myers-Briggs quizzes helped me learn more about how I process information and interact with others. Hearing my group members share their results made me more aware of the different ways we approach tasks, and I think that will help us work better together moving forward. It also made me reflect on some of my own habits—what helps me focus, what slows me down, and how I can be more productive. Going back to the dataset work after the session gave me a chance to apply that awareness and think about how I contribute to the team.

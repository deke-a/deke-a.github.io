what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how to perform sentiment analysis using a guided YouTube tutorial. I followed along to understand the basic steps involved—importing data, cleaning text, applying sentiment classification, and interpreting the results. After that, I applied what I learned by creating my own dataset focused on cultural features across three countries. I adapted the process to analyze my custom data, which helped me better understand how sentiment analysis can be used beyond social media or reviews. This hands-on practice improved my confidence in using data science tools, especially for processing text and drawing conclusions from categorical data.

  No blocks.

reflection: |
  Today was a good balance of learning and applying. Watching the tutorial gave me a practical foundation, but building my own dataset and running sentiment analysis on it helped me understand the process more deeply. It wasn’t just about copying code—I had to think critically about how to adapt the method to a different kind of data. Creating the stacked column chart also pushed me to explore pivot tables and visualize patterns in a more meaningful way. I’m starting to see how text and categorical data can be transformed into insights, and that feels like real progress.

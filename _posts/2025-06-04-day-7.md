what_i_learned: |
  Today, I practiced building a website for the first time using HTML and CSS. These were new tools for me, so I focused on understanding the basic structure of a webpage, how to style elements, and how to organize content visually. I also created a demo version of the website for our project, which helped me apply what I was learning in real time. In the afternoon, I met with my faculty and graduate mentor to discuss our goals and expectations for the project. We talked about how we want our progress to look over the coming weeks and how we can support each other throughout the research process.

blockers: |
  The main challenge today was getting familiar with HTML and CSS since they were new to me. It took some time to understand how the structure and styling work together, especially when it came to aligning elements and troubleshooting display issues. However, I was able to work through most of it with trial, error, and support. No major blockers at the moment, but I’ll need more practice to feel confident building responsive layouts and using CSS more efficiently.


reflection: |
  Today was my first real hands-on experience with HTML and CSS, and it felt both challenging and rewarding. At first, it was a bit overwhelming learning how to structure and style a webpage from scratch, but actually seeing my work come together as a live demo was motivating. I appreciated being able to apply what I was learning directly to our project. Talking with my faculty and graduate mentors helped ground the technical work in a bigger picture — it reminded me that the goal isn’t just to build a website, but to build something meaningful. I’m excited to keep improving and contribute more as I learn.

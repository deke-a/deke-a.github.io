what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued researching news articles for countries in the African diaspora, focusing on the pre-slavery, slavery, and post-slavery periods. Since I’ve been doing this for the past few days, I already feel confident identifying credible sources. My focus now is on finding new information and filling in any gaps for each country. I’m learning more about the historical patterns and unique experiences across regions, which is helping me see broader connections in the diaspora’s history.

reflection: |
  Reflecting on today, I feel more confident in my research process. At this point, I’m not just collecting sources—I’m noticing patterns and differences across countries that help me understand the diaspora in a deeper way. It’s interesting to see how similar historical forces played out differently depending on the region. Staying organized and consistent has made the process more manageable, and I’m starting to think more critically about how all this information fits into the larger goals of our project.

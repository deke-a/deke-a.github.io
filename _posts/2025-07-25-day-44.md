what_i_learned: |
  Today, I attended a robotics workshop with the rest of the program members, led by a professor and one of his students from the University of Alabama. During the session, we explored brain-computer interface technology by connecting sensors to our arms and using code to control a small robot. We also participated in an activity where we controlled a drone using our brain waves, which was a unique and engaging experience. After the workshop, I rejoined my group and continued working on our project, focusing on the remaining tasks we need to complete.

reflection: |
  Today’s robotics workshop was one of the most engaging sessions we’ve had so far. Getting hands-on experience with brain-computer interface technology made the concept feel real and showed me how coding, hardware, and neuroscience can come together in creative ways. Controlling a robot and a drone with brain activity was something I never imagined doing before, and it pushed me to think about how this kind of tech could be used in everyday life. It was a good break from our regular routine, but also motivating—it reminded me that the work we’re doing can lead to bigger possibilities if we stay curious and open-minded.

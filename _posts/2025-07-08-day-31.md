what_i_learned: |
  I started researching literature resources for the literature review section of my research paper. I search for academic articles, reports, and credible sources that directly relate to my research topic. I focus on identifying recurring themes, important findings, and any noticeable gaps in the current body of work. As I go through each source, I take notes on how they connect to my research questions and what perspectives they offer. I also began sorting the materials by relevance and strength, so it’ll be easier to reference them later. This process helps me build a stronger foundation for my paper and understand how my work fits into the broader conversation.

reflection: |
  Starting the literature review shows me how much existing research can shape the direction of my own work. It’s not just about collecting sources—it’s about understanding how different perspectives connect, where they conflict, and what’s missing. I notice how important it is to stay organized early on, because it saves time later when writing and citing. This step also helps me sharpen my research focus by showing what’s already been said and where I can contribute something new.

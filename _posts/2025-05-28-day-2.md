what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued building my Python skills. I practiced writing functions, using loops, and working with lists — especially list slicing and while loops. It helped me better understand how to structure code and break problems down into smaller steps. I also reviewed how to write clean, readable code with proper indentation and simple logic.

  Outside of coding, we got the chance to meet our program directors. It was a good opportunity to introduce ourselves, hear more about their roles, and ask questions about what to expect from the program. The session ended on a fun note with a game of Headbanz, which helped everyone relax and bond more as a group.

blockers: |
  There were no blocks.

reflection: |
  It was good practice and helped me review some old Python knowledge. Going over loops and functions reminded me how important the basics are. Even though I’ve seen some of it before, writing the code myself made it stick better. Meeting the program directors also made everything feel more real—it was nice to put faces to names. Ending the session with a game made the day feel balanced and reminded me that learning doesn’t always have to be serious.

what_i_learned: |
  Even though I wasn’t physically present in the office today, I still contributed remotely. We began our research on the African Diaspora and focused on exploring its cultural depth. I ylearned about the diverse traditions, religious practices, and cultural expressions across different regions. This included understanding how history, migration, and identity shape the experiences of African-descended communities around the world. It was a foundational step that will guide the direction of our project moving forward.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me that presence isn’t always physical—contribution can still be meaningful from anywhere. Even though I wasn’t in the office, I stayed engaged and helped push our research forward. Exploring the African Diaspora gave me a deeper appreciation for how layered and diverse Black identity is. Learning about the different cultural practices, religions, and histories made me realize how important it is to approach this project with care and respect. I’m excited to keep building on this foundation and bring more context into the work we’re doing.

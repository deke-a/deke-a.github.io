what_i_learned: |
  Today, I gained a clearer understanding of my role in the CEAMLS SAIRI program and the goals of our group project, the African Diaspora Media Hub. I learned how the project will explore the historical and cultural links between African countries and countries in the diaspora, shaped by the transatlantic slave trade. I also attended a session led by Dr. Waters, where we were introduced to key AI concepts such as independent and dependent groups, outliers, and the idea of training AI systems. Later, our graduate mentor Raisa discussed additional AI topics, including overfeeding and underfeeding, and explained what our team would be working on over the summer. I learned about the importance of applying AI to cultural research and how this project combines history, data, and media to create an educational platform. I also had the chance to meet my team and mentors, which helped me feel more connected to the work ahead.

reflection: |
  Today marked the official start of the CEAMLS SAIRI program, and it felt both exciting and grounding. Meeting the program directors, mentors, and my group members in person helped make everything feel more real. I appreciated the structure of the day—from the AI lecture by Dr. Waters to the group bonding activity and lab session—because it gave me a well-rounded view of what to expect moving forward.

  Hearing about the African Diaspora Media Hub project made me reflect on how deep and interconnected the African diaspora really is. It’s not just about geography; it’s about history, culture, and survival. I’m excited that our work will center those stories and make them accessible through technology.

  The AI concepts introduced today—like independent/dependent groups and overfeeding/underfeeding—were new to me in this context, and I’m looking forward to seeing how they’ll tie into the project. I’m also grateful for the way our graduate mentor broke things down and explained the summer expectations. It helped me feel more prepared and confident about what's ahead.

  Overall, today helped me see the bigger picture: I’m not just learning technical skills—I’m helping to build something meaningful.

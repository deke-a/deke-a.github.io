what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on learning HTML to prepare for building a website with my group for our project. I explored the basics of HTML structure and how it can be used to create and organize content on a webpage. This learning will help me contribute to the development of our site. Although I had to leave early due to personal matters, I made progress toward understanding the foundation of web development.

reflection: |
  Even though today was cut short, I’m glad I made progress with HTML. Learning how webpages are structured is important for the role I’ll play in my group project, and I feel more prepared to contribute. What matters is that I used the time I had productively. Moving forward, I want to keep building on what I learned today and apply it directly to our website work.

what_i_learned: |
  I researched news articles about the countries my group is focusing on for our project today. I looked into events and conditions before slavery, during slavery, and after slavery to understand the historical context and long-term effects. I compiled all the information into a single document, which will help us compare different timelines and patterns across regions. This research gave me a better understanding of how slavery shaped social, economic, and political systems in each country.

reflection: |
  Researching the history of slavery across different countries helped me see how deeply it has shaped each society. Reading about the periods before, during, and after slavery showed me how patterns of exploitation, resistance, and recovery differ from place to place. It was challenging to find accurate and balanced sources, but organizing everything into one document made the information clearer. This step helped me connect the past to current issues and prepared me to contribute more effectively to my group’s project.

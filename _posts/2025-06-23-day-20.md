what_i_learned: |
  Today, I started working on the Maps section of the African Diaspora Media Hub website. I began building out a layout that includes dropdown menus for Countries and Continents, which will eventually display historical maps from the pre-slavery, slavery, and post-slavery periods. I also made sure the “Historical Map Archives” heading is positioned to be clearly visible when users scroll down. Although I haven’t finished the section yet, planning the structure helped me better understand how to organize content for clarity and user engagement.

  
blockers: |
  One blocker I encountered was figuring out how to make the dropdown menus dynamically display the correct maps based on the selected category. Since I’m not using JavaScript, it’s been tricky to create interactive functionality using just HTML and CSS. I also had to start completely from scratch today, which slowed down my progress as I had to re-plan the entire structure and re-upload new images for the maps.


reflection: |
  Today pushed me to think more intentionally about structure and user flow. Starting from scratch was frustrating, but it also gave me the chance to clarify what I really wanted the Maps tab to look and feel like. Even though I ran into limitations without using JavaScript, it challenged me to be creative with HTML and CSS. I’m learning that good design isn’t just about visuals—it’s also about how clearly the user can navigate and understand what they’re seeing. I’m not done yet, but I feel more confident about the direction I’m taking.

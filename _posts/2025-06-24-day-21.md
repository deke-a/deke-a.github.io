what_i_learned: |
  I continued working on the maps for the African Diaspora Media Hub project. I finished organizing and renaming the map files, sorted them into the correct folders, and began connecting them to the frontend. I reviewed the code structure to figure out how to display each map by time period and region. Although I'm still in the process of linking everything, this helped me get more comfortable with handling visual content and updating the website layout.
  
blockers: |
  Today, one blocker I faced was that not all the maps are showing up correctly on the frontend, likely due to file path or folder structure issues. Only Africa is currently included in the continent code, so I’ll need to update that to include the others. I’m also still deciding whether all maps should stay in static/maps or be fully moved into the new countries and continents folders. These small structural issues are slowing down the full connection process.


reflection: |
  Today’s work helped me see how important clear file organization and consistent naming are when managing visual content for a website. Even though I faced some blockers with getting all the maps to display properly, it pushed me to pay closer attention to how files are structured and linked in the code. I also realized that keeping track of small details, like folder names and image paths, can make a big difference in how smoothly the frontend works. Overall, the experience is helping me become more confident in handling the technical side of web development.

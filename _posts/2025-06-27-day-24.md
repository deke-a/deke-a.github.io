what_i_learned: |
  I reviewed and verified a dataset filled with news articles, videos, media, and books for our project today. After confirming the accuracy of each source, I organized the verified content into a CSV file to support the coding process. This helped sharpen my skills in evaluating diverse media types and structuring data for practical use. The verification isn’t complete yet, but I made good progress.

reflection: |
  Verifying this dataset made me realize how important accuracy is when working with multiple media sources. It's easy to overlook small errors, but those can affect the quality of the final product. Organizing the information into a CSV also showed me how structure directly impacts how well the code can use the data. Even though I didn’t finish everything, the process reminded me that taking time to do things right is more valuable than rushing through.

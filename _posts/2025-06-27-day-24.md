what_i_learned: |
  Today, I wrapped up final edits on the CSV file I’ve been building for the project, making sure everything was accurate and clean. My group and I also presented our progress to a group of university officials, which helped me practice summarizing our work clearly and answering questions on the spot. It gave me a sense of how our project is viewed by others and what aspects stand out most. We ended the day by recording our weekly video update, which reinforced the importance of consistent documentation and reflection throughout the process.

reflection: |
  Presenting to university officials today made me reflect on how far our group has come and how much clarity matters when explaining our work. It was rewarding to see our efforts being acknowledged, but it also reminded me that good data work isn’t enough—communication matters just as much. Finalizing the CSV taught me to be thorough with details, and working on the project video helped reinforce the importance of staying consistent and organized week to week. Overall, today showed me the value of both behind-the-scenes work and public-facing presentation.

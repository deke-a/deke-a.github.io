  Today, I researched AI tools that can help with creating videos for the website. I focus on platforms that offer features like text-to-video conversion, voiceovers, subtitles, and customization options that don’t require advanced editing skills. I look into tools that can take written content or images and turn them into short, engaging videos that match the tone and purpose of the site. I also compare pricing, export quality, and ease of use to figure out which ones would be most practical for our project. This research helps lay the groundwork for how we might present information more visually and make the site more interactive.

  I realize how important it is to choose the right tools based on both function and ease of use. A lot of the platforms offer similar features, but not all of them align with our needs or skill level. Some are too complex, while others lack flexibility. This process shows me that even when tools seem helpful, they need to be practical for the team to use efficiently. It also reminds me that visuals—especially video—can be a powerful way to share information, but only if the tools behind them actually support our goals.

what_i_learned: |
  Today, my team and I focused on practicing our presentation to make sure everything flowed smoothly. We finalized the order in which each person would speak, adjusted our transitions, and made sure everyone was comfortable with their parts. After that, we had a session with Mr. Jason Riggens, a library official, who spoke to us about how to properly research and verify the information we use. He also introduced us to several useful academic databases and websites that could help us find more reliable and diverse sources for our project. It was a helpful reminder to stay critical of where our information comes from and to always aim for credibility.

reflection: |
  Practicing the presentation helped me feel more prepared and confident about our delivery. It also showed me how important it is for the group to be in sync so that our message comes across clearly. Hearing from Mr. Jason made me think more carefully about the quality of the sources we use and how to tell if information is trustworthy. I left the session with new tools and a better mindset for approaching the next stage of our research.

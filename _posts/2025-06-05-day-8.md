what_i_learned: |
  I went on a tour of the school, which helped me get more familiar with the campus and the resources available to us. After lunch, we reviewed some of the tools and materials we practiced earlier this week, like HTML, CSS, and Python. It was a good chance to reinforce what I’ve learned so far. Later, I started working on my project video with my group members, which gave me a chance to reflect on my progress and think about how to explain my work clearly and confidently.

reflection: |
  Looking back on today, I feel more grounded in the program. The campus tour helped me feel more connected to the space I’m working in, and reviewing past materials showed me how much I’ve already picked up in just a few days. Starting the project video was a bit challenging, but it pushed me to think critically about how to explain my ideas. I realized I understand more than I thought, but I also see areas where I need more clarity—especially when it comes to talking about the technical side of things.

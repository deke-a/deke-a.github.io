what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on wrapping up the datasets I’ve been building for the project. I was able to make strong progress and now have the majority of the entries completed and organized. At this point, I’m almost done—what remains is to carefully review each entry to confirm that all the sources are verified, properly cited, and come from reliable platforms. This final pass will help ensure that the data we’re using is both accurate and credible, which is especially important since these datasets will support our research paper and be part of the final website.

reflection: |
  Finishing up the datasets today felt like a major step forward. It reminded me how much time and effort it takes to build something reliable from the ground up. I’ve been working on these for a while, so reaching this stage gave me a sense of progress. At the same time, I know the verification process is just as important—accuracy and trustworthiness can’t be rushed. Going into the next phase, I want to stay focused on the details and make sure everything we include is solid and well-supported.

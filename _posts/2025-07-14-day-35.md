what_i_learned: |
  Today, I started working properly on the literature review section of our research paper. I focused on reviewing the sources we’ve gathered so far and began organizing them into themes that connect to our project goals. Later in the day, we had a meeting with our faculty mentor, where he shared some helpful resources we can use to build out the film and video section of our dataset. The suggestions gave us more direction on how to move forward with that part of the project.

reflection: |
  Starting the literature review made me realize how important it is to clearly link our sources to the purpose of our project. It’s not just about finding articles—it’s about showing how each one supports our research focus. Organizing the information into themes helped me see the bigger picture. The meeting with our faculty mentor was also really helpful. The new resources he shared for the film and video dataset gave us a clearer path forward and made me feel more confident about the direction we’re taking.

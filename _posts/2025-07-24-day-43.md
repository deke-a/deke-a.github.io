what_i_learned: |
  Today, my group and I had the opportunity to present our project to Mr. Bakari from The Sports and Entertainment Group and Mr. Oliver from New York Public Radio. During the meeting, they asked several clarifying questions that pushed us to think more critically about our project’s purpose and structure. They also gave us useful suggestions on additional features we could include or ways to improve how we communicate our ideas. Their insights helped us identify a few areas we hadn’t fully developed. After the presentation, we shifted our focus back to the 90-second elevator pitch, working on final edits to the script and visuals. We made adjustments based on the feedback and practiced how to present it clearly and confidently before submitting.

  Presenting to Mr. Bakari and Mr. Oliver gave me a better understanding of how our project is viewed by professionals outside of our immediate circle. Their questions highlighted areas we needed to explain more clearly, and their suggestions opened up new ideas we hadn’t considered before. It reminded me that feedback isn’t just about fixing mistakes—it’s about finding ways to grow and improve. Working on the elevator pitch right after the meeting also helped me apply their input right away, which made the process feel more purposeful. It was a good reminder to always stay open to critique and be ready to adjust.

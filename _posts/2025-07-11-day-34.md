what_i_learned: |
  I continued working on the datasets for our project, making sure the entries are accurate and consistent. I also had some helpful conversations with my high school teacher about different resources and websites we could use to support our research. We discussed tools that could help with data verification, citation, and finding credible information for the paper. The input gave me new ideas on how to strengthen our content and make the dataset more useful moving forward.

reflection: |
  Talking with my high school teacher gave me a new perspective on how to approach our research. I realized there are a lot more tools and databases out there that we haven’t fully explored yet. It also reminded me that asking questions and getting input from others can really improve the quality of our work. Working on the datasets again helped reinforce the importance of accuracy and consistency, especially since this data will directly support our final paper.

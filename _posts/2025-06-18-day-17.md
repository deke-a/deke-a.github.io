what_i_learned: |
  I met the high school teachers we'll be working with for the rest of the summer today and had the chance to get acquainted with them. We did a quick icebreaker to introduce ourselves and start building a collaborative environment. Then, we explained the foundation of our project so they could understand the goals and direction we're headed in. After that, I returned to working on the dataset, continuing to organize and complete the information we’ve been collecting. This experience helped me practice communicating my work clearly and start building relationships with new team members.

reflection: |
  Reflecting on today, it was a good reminder of how important communication and collaboration are in group projects. Meeting the teachers gave me a chance to practice explaining our work in a clear and simple way, which helped me better understand it myself. It also felt good to start building connections with the people we’ll be working closely with this summer. I’m looking forward to learning from their perspectives and seeing how our teamwork will help strengthen the project.

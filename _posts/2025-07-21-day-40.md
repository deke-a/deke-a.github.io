what_i_learned: |
  Today, I attended a general body meeting where Michael walked us through how to format our final research paper using Overleaf. He showed us how to structure the paper correctly and how to use BibTeX to manage and insert citations. The session helped clear up some confusion about formatting and referencing standards for our submission. After the meeting, I continued working with my group on finalizing the datasets, making sure everything is complete and ready to be included in the paper.

  Today’s session helped me feel more prepared to start writing the final research paper. I had a basic understanding of Overleaf before, but learning how to use BibTeX for citations made things more manageable. It showed me how important it is to keep our sources organized and correctly formatted from the start. I also realized how much cleaner and more professional a paper looks when the formatting is consistent. As we finish up our datasets, I’m starting to think more about how to transition smoothly into the writing phase.

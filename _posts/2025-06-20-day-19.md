what_i_learned: |
  I kept building on my research by finding more news articles across the pre-slavery, slavery, and post-slavery periods for different African diaspora countries. This time, I made sure to record each article’s title and author directly into the dataset. Doing that helped me stay organized and made it easier to keep track of where each piece of information came from. It also reminded me how important it is to credit sources properly and pay attention to who’s writing the history I'm reading.

reflection: |
  I feel like I’m becoming more thorough with my research process. Taking the extra step to note article titles and authors helped me stay organized and made the dataset more complete. It also pushed me to think more about source transparency and authorship—how the identity and perspective of a writer can influence how history is told. I’m starting to see how these small details matter in shaping the accuracy and credibility of our final project.

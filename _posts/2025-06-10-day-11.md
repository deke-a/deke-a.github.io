what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on two major tasks. First, I created a dataset on four core countries we’ll be working with—Nigeria, Senegal, The Gambia, and Sierra Leone—gathering key historical and cultural information that will shape our site content. This helped me think critically about how to organize and structure data for accessibility and engagement. Then I shifted to learning HTML and CSS to begin building the website. I practiced writing basic elements, styling with CSS, and understanding how layout and design choices affect user experience. It was my first hands-on step toward developing the platform's front end.  

  
blockers: |
  Minor blocker: adjusting to the structure of HTML/CSS and figuring out how to align content the way I envisioned. Still working through layout challenges, but it’s improving with practice.


reflection: |
  Today felt like a productive step forward. Creating the dataset gave me a clearer sense of how much content we’re working with and how important structure will be. Learning HTML and CSS was a bit challenging at first, but it was exciting to see how the code translates into a visual design. It made the project feel more real, and I’m looking forward to building something that’s both informative and engaging.

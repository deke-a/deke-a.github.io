what_i_learned: |
  Today, I expanded my Python skills by working on more advanced file I/O tasks and exploring core concepts in generative AI and machine learning. In Python, I practiced reading and writing structured data, using dictionaries and lists to organize content from files, and performing basic analysis like calculating averages and summarizing results in new files. I completed hands-on projects like a number report and a city weather log analyzer.

  Later, I was introduced to how generative AI works, including how models are trained on large datasets to generate human-like responses or images. I also learned how machine learning algorithms recognize patterns and make predictions based on data. These concepts helped me see the connection between data processing in code and how real-world AI systems function.

reflection: |
  Today helped me connect the dots between the code I write and the technologies shaping the future. Working on advanced file I/O in Python made me more confident in handling real-world data—reading from files, organizing information with dictionaries, and summarizing results in a clear way. It felt good to build full programs that actually analyze and report useful insights.

  Learning about generative AI and machine learning added another layer to my understanding. I realized how important data is—not just in programming tasks, but in training intelligent systems. It made me more curious about how models are built and how AI learns from patterns. Seeing both the practical coding side and the conceptual side of AI in the same day gave me a better picture of how these skills can come together.

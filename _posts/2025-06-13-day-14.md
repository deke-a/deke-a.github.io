what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued researching news articles on the pre-slavery, slavery, and post-slavery periods for additional countries in the African diaspora. I learned how to evaluate and organize historical sources for relevance and accuracy. I also worked on my project overview video, which helped me better understand how to clearly present my project’s goals, methods, and impact to an audience. This process improved my communication skills and reinforced the key objectives of my summer research.

reflection: |
  Today pushed me to stay focused and organized while handling repetitive but necessary research tasks. Finding credible articles for different countries wasn’t always easy, but it helped me think more critically about historical narratives and whose voices are represented. Creating the project overview video was a new experience — it made me realize how important it is to communicate ideas clearly and confidently. I’m starting to see how everything I’m doing connects: research, media, and storytelling all play a role in building this project.

what_i_learned: |
  I participated in the second writing workshop with the other CEAMLS program members where we focused on strengthening our research writing skills. The session provided a deeper understanding of how to write a strong literature review, including how to organize sources, identify research gaps, and connect ideas clearly. We also went over how to properly format citations using different academic styles, which helped clarify some of the confusion I had before. After the meeting, I rejoined my group to continue working on our project, applying some of what I had just learned to our ongoing work.

reflection: |
  Today's session helped me feel more confident about writing the literature review section of our research paper. Before, I wasn’t sure how to structure the review or connect the sources effectively, but the breakdown we received made it much clearer. Learning about proper citation methods was also useful since it's easy to overlook formatting details. I plan to start revising our current draft with these tips in mind. Overall, the session reminded me how important it is to understand the “why” behind each part of the paper, not just the “how.”

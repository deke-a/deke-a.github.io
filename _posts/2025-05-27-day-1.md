what_i_learned: |
  I learned the basics of Git and GitHub. Git is a version control system that helps track changes in code. GitHub is an online platform where you can store and share your Git repositories. I practiced creating a repository, making commits to save changes, and pushing my code to GitHub. I also learned how to clone a repo, pull updates, and understand the purpose of branches for working on different features without affecting the main code. This helps with collaboration and keeping code organized.

  No blockers!

reflection: |
  Learning Git and GitHub was a bit confusing at first, but once I understood the flow—like making commits and pushing to GitHub—it started to make sense. I realized how important version control is, especially when working with others or managing different versions of a project. It felt good to see my code live on GitHub, and now I feel more confident contributing to projects in the future.

  bio: |
    I’m currently a sophomore studying Computer Information Systems and Cybersecurity at Grambling State University in Grambling, Louisiana. I expect to graduate in 2028.

    My work explores the intersection of hardware and intelligence—how wearable devices and embedded systems can help people better understand their health and environment.

    When I’m not working on research, I enjoy mentoring younger students, playing jazz trumpet, and tinkering with Raspberry Pi projects in my free time.

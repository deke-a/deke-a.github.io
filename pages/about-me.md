  bio: |
    I'm a sophomore at Grambling State University, majoring in Computer Information Systems with a minor in Cybersecurity, on track to graduate in 2028. I’m especially interested in how technology can be used to make systems smarter, safer, and more responsive to real-world needs.

    Right now, I’m exploring how digital tools—like AI, media platforms, and connected devices—can empower underrepresented communities and reshape how we share stories, protect data, and build networks. Whether I’m building my first website, working on a research team, or troubleshooting code, I enjoy figuring out how things work and how they can work better.

    Outside the classroom, I mentor other students, serve as a Community Assistant, and stay involved in projects that blend tech, creativity, and service. I’m curious by nature and always looking for ways to grow—one experiment, one line of code, or one conversation at a time.
